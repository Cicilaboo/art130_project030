                <p>I was born in California to a funny dad, sweet mom, and a very annoying brother. As a lot of siblings, my brother and I didnâ€™t have a very good relationship. My mom always said we would grow up and love each other. I am now 20 and barely speak to my brother. My mother is not happy about it.</p>
                <p>And that is a little bit of my life story. Hope you had fun reading!</p>
